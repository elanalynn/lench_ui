  <h2>Not just for Lennies anymore!</h2>
  <p>
    Lench is a tool to help make lunch decisions easier. 
    People may have dietary preferences, restrictions, or 
    sometimes just dislike certain lunch destinations.
  </p>
  <p>
    With Lench, you can get restaurant recommendations, 
    based on who is in your lunch group, who is in the office,
    and a number of other filters (coming soon).
